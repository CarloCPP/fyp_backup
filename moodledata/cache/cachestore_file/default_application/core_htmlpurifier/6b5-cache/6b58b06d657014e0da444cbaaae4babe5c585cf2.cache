s:747:"<p>Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. <i>For example, create a story context for (2/3) รท (3/4) and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (2/3) รท (3/4) = 8/9 because 3/4 of 8/9 is 2/3. (In general, (a/b) รท (c/d) = ad/bc.) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt?
