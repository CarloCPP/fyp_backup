s:495:"<p>(+) Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated; find the expected value. <i>For example, find the theoretical probability distribution for the number of correct answers obtained by guessing on all five questions of a multiple-choice test where each question has four choices, and find the expected grade under various grading schemes.</i></p><p><strong>Grade levels</strong><br />09, 10, 11, 12</p>";
