s:444:"<p>Give examples of linear equations in one variable with one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions. Show which of these possibilities is the case by successively transforming the given equation into simpler forms, until an equivalent equation of the form <i>x</i> = <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> = <i>a</i>, or <i>a</i> = <i>b</i> results (where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are different numbers).</p><p><strong>Grade levels</strong><br />08</p>";
