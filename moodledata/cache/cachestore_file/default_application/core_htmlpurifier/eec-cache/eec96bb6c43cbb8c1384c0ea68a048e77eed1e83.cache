Perform arithmetic operations, including those involving whole-number exponents, in the conventional order when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order (Order of Operations). <i>For example, use the formulas V = s<sup>3</sup> and A = 6 s<sup>2</sup> to find the volume and surface area of a cube with sides of length s = 1/2</i>.</p><p><strong>Grade levels</strong><br />06</p>";
