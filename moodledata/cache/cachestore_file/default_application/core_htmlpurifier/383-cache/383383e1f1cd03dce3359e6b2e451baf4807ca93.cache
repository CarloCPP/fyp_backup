s:513:"<p>Solve word problems leading to equations of the form <i>px</i> + <i>q</i> = <i>r</i> and <i>p</i>(<i>x</i> + <i>q</i>) = <i>r</i>, where <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, and <i>r</i> are specific rational numbers. Solve equations of these forms fluently. Compare an algebraic solution to an arithmetic solution, identifying the sequence of the operations used in each approach. <i>For example, the perimeter of a rectangle is 54 cm. Its length is 6 cm. What is its width?</i></p><p><strong>Grade levels</strong><br />07</p>";
