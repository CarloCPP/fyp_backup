s:444:"<p>Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g., π<sup>2</sup>). <i>For example, by truncating the decimal expansion of √2, show that √2 is between 1 and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations</i>.</p><p><strong>Grade levels</strong><br />08</p>";
