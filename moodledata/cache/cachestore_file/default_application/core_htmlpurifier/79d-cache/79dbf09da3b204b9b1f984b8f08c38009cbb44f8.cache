s:465:"<p>Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents follows from extending the properties of integer exponents to those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational exponents. <i>For example, we define 5<sup>1/3</sup> to be the cube root of 5 because we want (5<sup>1/3</sup>)<sup>3</sup> = 5<sup>(1/3)3</sup> to hold, so (5<sup>1/3</sup>)<sup>3</sup> must equal 5</i>.</p><p><strong>Grade levels</strong><br />09, 10, 11, 12</p>";
